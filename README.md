To start building an app with panels and menus that are tailored to the user's data, you'll need to follow a structured approach. Here's a high-level overview of the process:

1. **Define User Data**: Determine what user data you will be displaying or managing in the app. This could include user profiles, preferences, or any other data relevant to your application.

2. **Design the UI/UX**: Create wireframes and designs for your app's panels and menus. Ensure that the design is intuitive and provides a good user experience.

3. **Choose the Right APIs**: Depending on the functionality you want to implement, you may need to integrate various APIs. For example, if you're handling user authentication, you might use OAuth or OpenID Connect.

4. **Develop the Functions**: Write the functions that will handle the user data. This includes functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting user data (CRUD operations).

5. **Implement the Panels**: Develop the panels that will display the user data. Make sure they are dynamic and can adjust based on the data they receive.

6. **Create the Menus**: Build the menus that will allow users to navigate through the app. The menus should be organized and make it easy for users to find what they're looking for.

7. **Testing**: Test your app thoroughly to ensure that all functions work correctly and the user data is handled securely.

8. **Iterate Based on Feedback**: After testing or releasing an initial version, gather user feedback and make necessary adjustments to the app's panels and menus.

Remember to follow best practices for app development, including maintaining a clean codebase, ensuring data privacy and security, and providing a responsive design for different devices. If you need more specific guidance on any of these steps, feel free to ask!
